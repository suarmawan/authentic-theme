###FAQ
####How to install _Authentic_ Theme?

#####Webmin

  To install _Autentic_ Theme from repository, just `clone` it into your wherever _Webmin_ binary folder _(libexec)_ is. After that, you must rename `authentic-theme-master` directory to `authentic-theme` to make the theme work properly. Besides, you could just [download](https://github.com/qooob/authentic-theme/releases/download/18.31/authentic-theme-18.31.wbt.gz) the theme directly and install it using _Webmin_:

  `Webmin->Webmin Configuration->Webmin Themes->Install themes->From uploaded file`

#####Usermin
  Use the same procedure as described above to install the theme for _Usermin_:

  `Webmin->Usermin Configuration->Usermin Themes->Install themes->From uploaded file`


#####Virtualmin/Cloudmin
There is no need to take any additional actions. In case _Virtualmin_ or/and _Cloudmin_ modules are installed, it will be automatically detected and supported.

####How to update _Authentic_ Theme automatically?
The theme has inbuilt feature to notify an administrative user to install updates. To enable this feature, turn `Check for Authentic Theme updates` on in theme settings.

####How do I customize the theme?
Theme has configurable options, that are located in `Webmin->Webmin Configuration->Webmin Themes`. There as well, you can upload custom _logos_ and code custom _styles.css_, _scripts.js_ and _scripts.pm_.


####How do I make user palettes work?
_Authentic_ Theme utilizes built-in, custom color palettes, that a user can define using theme's extensions. It's possible, by using theme's _CSS_ extensions, to pass user custom selector, such as `user-palette-1`, `user-palette-2`, `user-palette-3`, `user-palette-4`, `user-palette-5`, `user-palette-6`, `user-palette-7`, `user-palette-8`, `user-palette-9` and `user-palette-10` to enable a usage of user palettes. For example, in order to use `user-palette-1`, in the theme's settings, you would need to set the option _Navigation Menu Color_ to the value of `User Palette 1`. After that, provide a custom code to the theme's _CSS_ extension, with [a pre-built template](http://codepen.io/qooob/pen/dYaPvj), corresponding with custom theme's identification.

####How do I execute shell command using search field?
Type `!` in search, followed by your command. Example: `! ls -lsaZ /root`. It's required to have _Command Shell_ module available.

####How do I make the theme load faster?
_Webmin_ has in-built option to compress static files.  It's possible to enable this feature by going to `Webmin->Webmin Configuration->Web Server Options` and setting _Gzip compress static files_ option to _Use pre-compressed file and compress dynamically_.

Another solution would be to install used by default [_Roboto Font_](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/download/roboto "wget http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/download/roboto -O roboto.zip") locally to prevent extra load from embedding it and later setting it in the theme's settings accordingly.

###Extended support for bundled/third-party modules

####_File Manager_
Theme has great support for this module, by adding numerous mast-have features. Most noticeable are listing without page reload (using XHR requests) and full keyboard support, which enables you to use _File Manager_ just as normal desktop browser.

#####List of keyboard shortcuts

  * `alphanumeric typing` - quick search
  * `up/down, home/end` - cursor position
  * `enter` - descent into selected directory
  * `backspace` - previous folder
    * in case there is only one row filtered, enter on search field will perform trigger
  * `contextmenu/right-click` - context menu
  * `spacebar` or `Alt+right-click` - select current row
  * `right-click on path` or `Ctrl+L` - enter path manually
  * `*` - inverse select

####_ConfigServer Security & Firewall_
Theme only re-renders this module and adds support for code highlight, when editing files manually.


###Troubleshoot
1. Automatic updates notification feature doesn't work or `Can't locate Net/SSLeay.pm in ..)`<br>
   This happens because _Webmin_ is trying to open a link and download the theme using _https_ protocol. `Net::SSLeay` - is high level functions for accessing web servers (by using HTTP/HTTPS). You can install it using _Perl_ module in _Webmin_ or using _command-line_. Package name is `perl-Net-SSLeay`. Besides, in case you have mentioned module installed and automatic update feature still doesn't work, you would have to also install either `LWP::Protocol::https` or `Bundle::LWP` using _CPAN_ or by package name `perl-LWP-Protocol-https` or `perl-libwww-perl` respectively;
2. Strange `Ã‚` character is appeared in text-editor mode or other encoding issues<br>
   This happens because of encoding disparity. To fix this, just set language in _Webmin_ to `UTF-8` and make sure that your browser also has detected it as `UTF-8`. Pay attention, that _Webmin_ in-built module, named _Change Language and Theme_ can override global settings;
3. I get `HEAD 404 (File not found)` in console<br>
   That is not really an error. It happens, when theme is checking, if needed _URL_ exists and can be loaded;
4. Page loading got stuck<br>
   To prematurely dismiss a loader, hover on it and click loader's close button, right next to it. It is also possible to unveil currently loading content page by double clicking on it;
5. Can't toggle _checkbox_ in a row of a _table_<br>
   Theme provides an extended support for operations with table rows. It's easy to select current row by simply `right-clicking` on it with the mouse (on mobile device `long-tap`). Regular `click` on the row will take you to the row's main link;
6. Default tab after logging in doesn't work<br>
   You need to set _Authentic Theme_ as default globally. To do so, go to _Webmin->Webmin Configuration->Themes_.
7. Blinking navigation menu or overall jerky theme's rendering<br>
   This could happen to GPU driver misconfiguration on your OS. For more details refer to [#453](https://github.com/qooob/authentic-theme/issues/453)
